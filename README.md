# Mobile Coding Challenge 

## Idea of the App 
The task is to implement a small app that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. 
You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below). 

## Features
* As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. 
* As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row. 
* As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
  * Repository name
  * Repository description 
  * Numbers of stars for the repo. 
  * Username and avatar of the owner. 
* As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).


## Technologies to use

* For iOS, Flutter. 
* For Android, Flutter. 
* For Desktop, Flutter. 
* For Web, Flutter.
